    "news=\"\"\"In his strongly worded resignation letter which he tweeted after leaving the Parliament in the afternoon, Rahul Gandhi stressed on the fact that he had resigned taking accountability of the poll debacle.\n",
    "\"Rebuilding the party requires hard decisions and numerous people will have to be made accountable for the failure of 2019 it would be unjust to hold others accountable but ignore my own responsibility as president of the party,\" the letter said.\n",
    "\"As President of the Congress Party, I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. Accountability is critical for the future growth of our party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress President,\" he further wrote in an emotional pitch.\n",
    "Rahul Gandhi also stressed on the fact that there was need to bring radical changes and accountability for future growth. \"Congress needs to radically transform itself, it is party's duty to defend people's voices that BJP is crushing.\"\n",
    "Rahul Gandhi also justified his fight, \"I fought because I love India. At times I stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it,\" he said describing how he was left in the lurch by the seniors in the party.\n",
    "Rahul Gandhi also defended his campaign saying that he ran a \"strong and dignified campaign against the Prime Minister and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the institutions they have captured\".\n",
    "He alleged that \"capturing the country's institutional structure, is now complete... future elections could become mere rituals\".\n",
    "Rahul Gandhi said the Congress must reclaim the institutions but for that to happen, the party must transform.\n",
    "\"To achieve this important task, the Congress party must radically transform itself. Today the BJP is systematically crushing the voice of the Indian people. It is the duty of the Congress Party to defend these voices. India has never and will never be one voice. It is and always will be a symphony of voices. That is the true essence of Bharat Mata, he said.\n",
    "\"We didn’t fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution of which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India,\" he claimed.\n",
    "Rahul Gandhi said \"we need to set an example by not clinging to power\".\n",
    "\"It is a habit in India that the powerful cling to power, no one sacrifices power. But we will not defeat our opponents without sacrificing the desire for power and fighting a deeper ideological battle. I was born a Congressman...this party has always been with me and is my lifeblood and forever that way it shall remain,\" he said\"\"\""
